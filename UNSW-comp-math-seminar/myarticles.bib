Many efforts are being devoted to accelerate simulation times for practical industrial applications. The new approach suggested here, the virtual domain approximation, is a physics-based rationale for spatial reduction of the domain in the thermal finite-element analysis at the part scale. Computational experiments address, among others, validation against a large physical experiment of 17.5 [cm 3 ] of deposited volume in 647 layers. For fast and automatic parameter estimation at such level of complexity, a high-performance computing framework is employed. It couples FEMPAR-AM, a specialized parallel finite-element software, with Dakota, for the parametric exploration. Compared to previous state-of-the-art, this formulation provides higher accuracy at the same computational cost. This sets the path to a fully virtualized model, considering an upwards-moving domain covering the last printed layers.},

abstract = {In this work, we present scalable balancing domain decomposition by constraints methods for linear systems arising from arbitrary order edge finite element discretizations of multi-material and heterogeneous 3D problems. In order to enforce the continuity across subdomains of the method, we use a partition of the interface objects (edges and faces) into sub-objects determined by the variation of the physical coefficients of the problem. For multi-material problems, a constant coefficient condition is enough to define this sub-partition of the objects. For arbitrarily heterogeneous problems, a relaxed version of the method is defined, where we only require that the maximal contrast of the physical coefficient in each object is smaller than a predefined threshold. Besides, the addition of perturbation terms to the preconditioner is empirically shown to be effective in order to deal with the case where the two coefficients of the model problem jump simultaneously across the interface. The new method, in contrast to existing approaches for problems in curl-conforming spaces does not require spectral information whilst providing robustness with regard to coefficient jumps and heterogeneous materials. A detailed set of numerical experiments, which includes the application of the preconditioner to 3D realistic cases, shows excellent weak scalability properties of the implementation of the proposed algorithms.},

abstract = {In this work we propose a nonlinear stabilization technique for convection–diffusion–reaction and pure transport problems discretized with space–time isogeometric analysis. The stabilization is based on a graph-theoretic artificial diffusion operator and a novel shock detector for isogeometric analysis. Stabilization in time and space directions are performed similarly, which allow us to use high-order discretizations in time without any CFL-like condition. The method is proven to yield solutions that satisfy the discrete maximum principle (DMP) unconditionally for arbitrary order. In addition, the stabilization is linearity preserving in a space–time sense. Moreover, the scheme is proven to be Lipschitz continuous ensuring that the nonlinear problem is well-posed. Solving large problems using a space–time discretization can become highly costly. Therefore, we also propose a partitioned space–time scheme that allows us to select the length of every time slab, and solve sequentially for every subdomain. As a result, the computational cost is reduced while the stability and convergence properties of the scheme remain unaltered. In addition, we propose a twice differentiable version of the stabilization scheme, which enjoys the same stability properties while the nonlinear convergence is significantly improved. Finally, the proposed schemes are assessed with numerical experiments. In particular, we considered steady and transient pure convection and convection–diffusion problems in one and two dimensions.},

abstract = {Edge (or N{\'{e}}d{\'{e}}lec) finite elements are theoretically sound and widely used by the computational electromagnetics community. However, its implementation, especially for high order methods, is not trivial, since it involves many technicalities that are not properly described in the literature. To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive description of a general implementation of edge elements of first kind within the scientific software project FEMPAR . We cover into detail how to implement arbitrary order (i.e., p-adaptive) elements on hexahedral and tetrahedral meshes. First, we set the three classical ingredients of the finite element definition by Ciarlet, both in the reference and the physical space: cell topologies, polynomial spaces and moments. With these ingredients, shape functions are automatically implemented by defining a judiciously chosen polynomial pre-basis that spans the local finite element space combined with a change of basis to automatically obtain a canonical basis with respect to the moments at hand. Next, we discuss global finite element spaces putting emphasis on the construction of global shape functions through oriented meshes, appropriate geometrical mappings, and equivalence classes of moments, in order to preserve the inter-element continuity of tangential components of the magnetic field. Finally, we extend the proposed methodology to generate global curl-conforming spaces on non-conforming hierarchically refined (i.e., h-adaptive) meshes with arbitrary order finite elements. Numerical results include experimental convergence rates to test the proposed implementation.},

abstract = {Unfitted finite element methods, e.g., extended finite element techniques or the so-called finite cell method, have a great potential for large scale simulations, since they avoid the generation of body-fitted meshes and the use of graph partitioning techniques, two main bottlenecks for problems with non-trivial geometries. However, the linear systems that arise from these discretizations can be much more ill-conditioned, due to the so-called small cut cell problem. The state-of-the-art approach is to rely on sparse direct methods, which have quadratic complexity and are thus not well suited for large scale simulations. In order to solve this situation, in this work we investigate the use of domain decomposition preconditioners (balancing domain decomposition by constraints) for unfitted methods. We observe that a straightforward application of these preconditioners to the unfitted case has a very poor behavior. As a result, we propose a customization of the classical BDDC methods based on the stiffness weighting operator and an improved definition of the coarse degrees of freedom in the definition of the preconditioner. These changes lead to a robust and algorithmically scalable solver able to deal with unfitted grids. A complete set of complex 3D numerical experiments shows the good performance of the proposed preconditioners.},

abstract = {Unfitted finite element techniques are valuable tools in different applications where the generation of body-fitted meshes is difficult. However, these techniques are prone to severe ill conditioning problems that obstruct the efficient use of iterative Krylov methods and, in consequence, hindersthe practical usage of unfitted methods for realistic large scale applications. In this work, we present a technique that addresses such conditioning problems by constructing enhanced finite element spaces based on a cell aggregation technique. The presented method, called aggregated unfitted finite element method, is easy to implement, and can be used, in contrast to previous works, in Galerkin approximations of coercive problems with conforming Lagrangian finite element spaces. The mathematical analysis of the method states that the condition number of the resulting linear system matrix scales as in standard finite elements for body-fitted meshes, without being affected by small cut cells, and that the method leads to the optimal finite element convergence order. These theoretical results are confirmed with 2D and 3D numerical experiments.},

FEMPAR is a framework that provides users with out-of-the-box state-of-the-art discretization techniques and highly scalable solvers for the simulation of complex applications, hiding the dramatic complexity of the underlying algorithms. But it is also a framework for researchers that want to experience with new algorithms and solvers, by providing a highly extensible framework. In this work, the first one in a series of articles about FEMPAR, we provide a detailed introduction to the software abstractions used in the discretization module and the related geometrical module. We also provide some ingredients about the assembly of linear systems arising from finite element discretizations, but the software design of complex scalable multilevel solvers is postponed to a subsequent work.},

abstract = {In this work, we develop a high-performance numerical framework for the large eddy simulation (LES) of incompressible flows. The spatial discretization of the nonlinear system is carried out using mixed finite element (FE) schemes supplemented with symmetric projection stabilization of the convective term and a penalty term for the divergence constraint. These additional terms introduced at the discrete level have been proved to act as implicit LES models. In order to perform meaningful wall-unresolved simulations, we consider a weak imposition of the boundary conditions using a Nitsche's-type scheme, where the tangential component penalty term is designed to act as a wall law. Next, segregated Runge–Kutta (SRK) schemes (recently proposed by the authors for laminar flow problems) are applied to the LES simulation of turbulent flows. By the introduction of a penalty term on the trace of the acceleration, these methods exhibit excellent stability properties for both implicit and explicit treatment of the convective terms. SRK schemes are excellent for large-scale simulations, since they reduce the computational cost of the linear system solves by splitting velocity and pressure computations at the time integration level, leading to two uncoupled systems. The pressure system is a Darcy-type problem that can easily be preconditioned using a traditional block-preconditioning scheme that only requires a Poisson solver. At the end, only coercive systems have to be solved, which can be effectively preconditioned by multilevel domain decomposition schemes, which are both optimal and scalable. The framework is applied to the Taylor–Green and turbulent channel flow benchmarks in order to prove the accuracy of the convection-stabilized mixed FEs as LES models and SRK time integrators. The scalability of the preconditioning techniques (in space only) has also been proven for one step of the SRK scheme for the Taylor–Green flow using uniform meshes. Moreover, a turbulent flow around a NACA profile is solved to show the applicability of the proposed algorithms for a realistic problem.},

abstract = {This work is devoted to the design of interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (dG) schemes that preserve maximum principles at the discrete level for the steady transport and convection-diffusion problems and the respective transient problems with implicit time integration. Monotonic schemes that combine explicit time stepping with dG space discretization are very common, but the design of such schemes for implicit time stepping is rare, and it had only been attained so far for 1D problems. The proposed scheme is based on an artificial diffusion that linearly depends on a shock detector that identifies the troublesome areas. In order to define the new shock detector, we have introduced the concept of discrete local extrema. The diffusion operator is a graph-Laplacian, instead of the more common finite element discretization of the Laplacian operator, which is essential to keep monotonicity on general meshes and in multi-dimension. The resulting nonlinear stabilization is non-smooth and nonlinear solvers can fail to converge. As a result, we propose a smoothed (twice differentiable) version of the nonlinear stabilization, which allows us to use Newton with line search nonlinear solvers and dramatically improve nonlinear convergence. A theoretical numerical analysis of the proposed schemes show that they satisfy the desired monotonicity properties.

abstract = {In this work a finite-element framework for the numerical simulation of the heat transfer analysis of additive manufacturing processes by powder-bed technologies, such as Selective Laser Melting, is presented. These kind of technologies allow for a layer-by-layer metal deposition process to cost-effectively create, directly from a CAD model, complex functional parts such as turbine blades, fuel injectors, heat exchangers, medical implants, among others. The numerical model proposed accounts for different heat dissipation mechanisms through the surrounding environment and is supplemented by a finite-element activation strategy, based on the born-dead elements technique, to follow the growth of the geometry driven by the metal deposition process, in such a way that the same scanning pattern sent to the numerical control system of the AM machine is used. An experimental campaign has been carried out at the Monash Centre for Additive Manufacturing using an EOSINT-M280 machine where it was possible to fabricate different benchmark geometries, as well as to record the temperature measurements at different thermocouple locations. The experiment consisted in the simultaneous printing of two walls with a total deposition volume of 107 cm3in 992 layers and about 33,500 s build time. A large number of numerical simulations have been carried out to calibrate the thermal FE framework in terms of the thermophysical properties of both solid and powder materials and suitable boundary conditions. Furthermore, the large size of the experiment motivated the investigation of two different model reduction strategies: exclusion of the powder-bed from the computational domain and simplified scanning strategies. All these methods are analysed in terms of accuracy, computational effort and suitable applications.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose two-level space-time domain decomposition preconditioners for parabolic problems discretized using finite elements. They are motivated as an extension to space-time of balancing domain decomposition by constraints preconditioners. The key ingredients to be defined are the subassembled space and operator, the coarse degrees of freedom (DOFs) in which we want to enforce continuity among subdomains at the preconditioner level, and the transfer operator from the subassembled to the original finite element space. With regard to the subassembled operator, a perturbation of the time derivative is needed to end up with a well-posed preconditioner. The set of coarse DOFs includes the time average (at the space-time subdomain) of classical space constraints plus new constraints between consecutive subdomains in time. Numerical experiments show that the proposed schemes are weakly scalable in time, i.e., we can efficiently exploit increasing computational resources to solve more time steps in the same total elapsed time. Further, the scheme is also weakly space-time scalable, since it leads to asymptotically constant iterations when solving larger problems both in space and time. Excellent wall clock time weak scalability is achieved for space-time parallel solvers on some thousands of cores.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose a nonlinear stabilization technique for scalar conservation laws with implicit time stepping. The method relies on an artificial diffusion method, based on a graph-Laplacian operator. It is nonlinear, since it depends on a shock detector. Further, the resulting method is linearity preserving. The same shock detector is used to gradually lump the mass matrix. The resulting method is LED, positivity preserving, and also satisfies a global DMP. Lipschitz continuity has also been proved. However, the resulting scheme is highly nonlinear, leading to very poor nonlinear convergence rates. We propose a smooth version of the scheme, which leads to twice differentiable nonlinear stabilization schemes. It allows one to straightforwardly use Newton's method and obtain quadratic convergence. In the numerical experiments, steady and transient linear transport, and transient Burgers' equation have been considered in 2D. Using the Newton method with a smooth version of the scheme we can reduce 10 to 20 times the number of iterations of Anderson acceleration with the original non-smooth scheme. In any case, these properties are only true for the converged solution, but not for iterates. In this sense, we have also proposed the concept of projected nonlinear solvers, where a projection step is performed at the end of every nonlinear iterations onto a FE space of admissible solutions. The space of admissible solutions is the one that satisfies the desired monotonic properties (maximum principle or positivity).},

@article{badia_multilevel_2016,
abstract = {In this paper we present a fully distributed, communicator-aware, recursive, and interlevel-overlapped message-passing implementation of the multilevel balancing domain decomposition by constraints (MLBDDC) preconditioner. The implementation highly relies on subcommunicators in order to achieve the desired effect of coarse-grain overlapping of computation and communication, and communication and communication among levels in the hierarchy (namely, interlevel overlapping). Essentially, the main communicator is split into as many nonoverlapping subsets of message-passing interface (MPI) tasks (i.e., MPI subcommunicators) as levels in the hierarchy. Provided that specialized resources (cores and memory) are devoted to each level, a careful rescheduling and mapping of all the computations and communications in the algorithm lets a high degree of overlapping be exploited among levels. All subroutines and associated data structures are expressed recursively, and therefore MLBDDC preconditioners with an arbitrary number of levels can be built while re-using significant and recurrent parts of the codes. This approach leads to excellent weak scalability results as soon as level-1 tasks can fully overlap coarser-levels duties. We provide a model to indicate how to choose the number of levels and coarsening ratios between consecutive levels and determine qualitatively the scalability limits for a given choice. We have carried out a comprehensive weak scalability analysis of the proposed implementation for the three-dimensional Laplacian and linear elasticity problems on structured and unstructured meshes. Excellent weak scalability results have been obtained up to 458,752 IBM BG/Q cores and 1.8 million MPI being, being the first time that exact domain decomposition preconditioners (only based on sparse direct solvers) reach these scales.},

We prove that the perturbed {\{}BDDC{\}} has the same polylogarithmic bound for the condition number as the standard formulation. Two types of properly scaled zero-order perturbations are considered: one uses a mass matrix, and the other uses a Robin-type boundary condition, i.e, a mass matrix on the interface. With perturbation, the well-posedness of the local Neumann problems and the global coarse problem is automatically guaranteed, and coarse degrees of freedom can be defined only for convergence purposes but not well-posedness. This allows a much simpler implementation as no complicated corner selection algorithm is needed. Minimal coarse spaces using only face or edge constraints can also be considered. They are very useful in extreme scale calculations where the coarse problem is usually the bottleneck that can jeopardize scalability. The perturbation also adds extra robustness as the perturbed formulation works even when the constraints fail to eliminate a small number of subdomain rigid body modes from the standard {\{}BDDC{\}} space. This is extremely important when solving problems on unstructured meshes partitioned by automatic graph partitioners since arbitrary disconnected subdomains are possible.

Second, the proposed methods keep the same order of accuracy for both velocities and pressures. The segregated Runge-Kutta methods are motivated as an implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta time integration of the projected Navier-Stokes system onto the discrete divergence-free space, and its re-statement in a velocity-pressure setting using a discrete pressure Poisson equation.

This method is traditionally combined with equal-order velocity–pressure pairs, since it provides pressure stabilization. In this work, we consider a different approach, based on inf–sup stable elements and convection-only stabilization. In order to do so, we consider a symmetric projection stabilization of the convective term using an orthogonal subscale decomposition. The accuracy and efficiency of this method compared with residual-based algebraic subgrid scales and orthogonal subscales methods for equal-order interpolation is assessed in this paper. Moreover, when inf–sup stable elements are used, the grad–div stabilization term has been shown to be essential to guarantee accurate solutions. Hence, a study of the influence of such term in the large eddy simulation of turbulent incompressible flows is also performed. Furthermore, a recursive block preconditioning strategy has been considered for the resolution of the problem with an implicit treatment of the projection terms. Two different benchmark tests have been solved: the Taylor–Green Vortex flow with R e = 1600 , and the Turbulent Channel Flow at R e $\tau$ = 395 and R e $\tau$ = 590 .},

abstract = {In this work, we analyze the scalability of inexact two-level balancing domain decomposition by constraints (BDDC) preconditioners for Krylov subspace iterative solvers, when using a highly scalable asynchronous parallel implementation where fine and coarse correction computations are overlapped in time. This way, the coarse-grid problem can be fully overlapped by fine-grid computations (which are embarrassingly parallel) in a wide range of cases. Further, we consider inexact solvers to reduce the computational cost/complexity and memory consumption of coarse and local problems and boost the scalability of the solver. Out of our numerical experimentation, we conclude that the BDDC preconditioner is quite insensitive to inexact solvers. In particular, one cycle of algebraic multigrid (AMG) is enough to attain algorithmic scalability. Further, the clear reduction of computing time and memory requirements of inexact solvers compared to sparse direct ones makes possible to scale far beyond state-of-the-art BDDC implementations. Excellent weak scalability results have been obtained with the proposed inexact/overlapped implementation of the two-level BDDC preconditioner, up to 93,312 cores and 20 billion unknowns on JUQUEEN.

We consider VMS models obtained by different subgrid scale approximations which include either static or dynamic subscales, linear or nonlinear multiscale splitting, and different choices of the subscale space. After a brief review of these models, we discuss some implementation aspects particularly relevant to the simulation of turbulent flows, namely the use of a skew symmetric form of the convective term and the computation of projections when orthogonal subscales are used. We analyze the energy conservation (and numerical dissipation) of the alternative VMS formulations, which is numerically evaluated. In the numerical study, we have considered three well known problems: the decay of homogeneous isotropic turbulence, the Taylor–Green vortex problem and the turbulent flow in a channel. We compare the results obtained using different VMS models, paying special attention to the effect of using orthogonal subscale spaces. The VMS results are also compared against classical LES scheme based on filtering and the dynamic Smagorinsky closure. Altogether, our results show the tremendous potential of VMS for the numerical simulation of turbulence. Further, we study the sensitivity of VMS to the algorithmic constants and analyze the behavior in the small time step limit. We have also carried out a computational cost comparison of the different formulations. Out of these experiments, we can state that the numerical results obtained with the different VMS formulations (as far as they converge) are quite similar. However, some choices are prone to instabilities and the results obtained in terms of computational cost are certainly different. The dynamic orthogonal subscales model turns out to be best in terms of efficiency and robustness.},

Then, we propose novel nonlinear stabilization schemes in the form of an artificial viscosity method where the amount of viscosity is proportional to gradient jumps at either finite element boundaries or nodes.

They can be motivated by using a variational multiscale (VMS) framework, based on the decomposition of the fluid velocity into a resolvable FE component plus a modelled subgrid-scale component. The subgrid closure acts as a large eddy simulation turbulence model, leading to accurate under-resolved simulations. However, even though VMS formulations are increasingly used in the applied FE community, their numerical analysis has been restricted to a priori estimates and convergence to smooth solutions only, via a priori error estimates. In this work, we prove that some versions of these methods (based on dynamic and orthogonal closures) also converge to weak (turbulent) solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations. These results are obtained by using compactness results in Bochner–Lebesgue spaces.},

abstract = {The thermally coupled incompressible inductionless magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problem models the flow of an electrically charged fluid under the influence of an external electromagnetic field with thermal coupling. This system of partial differential equations is strongly coupled and highly nonlinear for real cases of interest. Therefore, fully implicit time integration schemes are very desirable in order to capture the different physical scales of the problem at hand. However, solving the multiphysics linear systems of equations resulting from such algorithms is a very challenging task which requires efficient and scalable preconditioners. In this work, a new family of recursive block LU preconditioners is designed and tested for solving the thermally coupled inductionless MHD equations. These preconditioners are obtained after splitting the fully coupled matrix into one-physics problems for every variable (velocity, pressure, current density, electric potential and temperature) that can be optimally solved, e.g., using preconditioned domain decomposition algorithms. The main idea is to arrange the original matrix into an (arbitrary) 2 × 2 block matrix, and consider an LU preconditioner obtained by approximating the corresponding Schur complement. For every one of the diagonal blocks in the LU preconditioner, if it involves more than one type of unknowns, we proceed the same way in a recursive fashion. This approach is stated in an abstract way, and can be straightforwardly applied to other multiphysics problems. Further, we precisely explain a flexible and general software design for the code implementation of this type of preconditioners. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The global set of MPI tasks is split into those that have fine-grid duties and those that have coarse-grid duties, and the different computations and communications in the algorithm are then re-scheduled and mapped in such a way that the maximum degree of overlapping is achieved while preserving data dependencies among them. In many ranges of interest, the extra cost associated to the coarse-grid problem can be fully masked by fine-grid related computations (which are embarrassingly parallel).

As model problems, we consider the Poisson and linear elasticity problems. On one hand, we propose a novel way to deal with singular matrices and pseudo-inverses appearing in local solvers. It is based on a kernel identification strategy that allows us to efficiently compute the action of the pseudo-inverse via local indefinite solvers. We further show how, identifying a minimum set of degrees of freedom to be fixed, an equivalent definite system can be solved instead, even in the elastic case. On the other hand, we propose a simple implementation of the algorithm that reduces the number of Dirichlet solvers to only one per iteration, leading to similar computational cost as additive methods. After these improvements of the BNN preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm, we compare its performance against that of the BDDC preconditioners on a pair of large-scale distributed-memory platforms. The enhanced BNN method is a competitive preconditioner for three-dimensional Poisson and elasticity problems and outperforms the BDDC method in many cases.

The idea is to start from a hybrid formulation of the problem involving as unknowns the main field in the interior of the element domains and its fluxes and traces on the element boundaries. Rather than working with this three-field formulation, fluxes are modeled using finite difference expressions and then the traces are determined by imposing continuity of fluxes, although other strategies could be devised. This procedure is applied to four elliptic problems, namely, the convection-diffusion equation (in the diffusion dominated regime), the Stokes problem, the Darcy problem and the Maxwell problem. We justify some well known dG methods with some modifications that in fact allow to improve the performance of the original methods, particularly when the physical properties are discontinuous. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this work we discuss two model problems appearing in magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD), namely, the so called full MHD problem and the inductionless MHD problem. The first involves as unknowns the fluid velocity and pressure, the magnetic (induction) field and a pseudo-pressure introduced to impose the zero-divergence restriction of this last unknown. The building blocks of this model are the Stokes problem for the velocity and the pressure and the Maxwell problem for the magnetic field and pseudo-pressure. We discuss the numerical challenges of the approximation of these two model problems having in mind the need to couple them in the full problem, where additional coupling terms appear. The second model we consider is the inductionless MHD approximation. Instead of the magnetic induction and pseudo-pressure, the magnetic unknowns are now the current density and the electric potential. The building blocks are the Stokes problem for the fluid and the Darcy problem (in primal form) for the current density and electric potential. We discuss also the numerical challenges involved in the approximation of this last problem, particularly considering that it has to be coupled to the former. Once the building blocks have been analysed independently, the possibilities of dealing with the fully coupled problems are discussed. Iterative schemes that can be shown to be stable are presented in the stationary case, showing that a segregated solution for the flow and the magnetic problem is not possible. Most of the results presented are elaborated independently in previous works. Our objective in this paper is to present the different problems with a unified perspective.},

The key feature of the FE formulation resides in the design of the stabilization terms, which serve several purposes. First, the formulation is suitable for convection dominated flows. Second, there is no need to use interpolation spaces constrained to a compatibility condition in both sub-problems and therefore, equal-order interpolation spaces can be used for all the unknowns.

For this reason, in this article we have developed a combined cG-dG formulation for Maxwell's problem that allows arbitrary finite element spaces with functions continuous in patches of finite elements and discontinuous on the interfaces of these patches. In particular, the second formulation we propose comes from a novel continuous Galerkin formulation that reduces the amount of stabilization introduced in the numerical system. In all cases, we have performed stability and convergence analyses of the methods. The outcome of this work is a new approach that keeps the low CPU cost of recent nodal continuous formulations with the ability to deal with coefficient jumps and adaptivity of discontinuous ones.

abstract = {In this work, we propose finite element schemes for the numerical approximation of nematic liquid crystal flows, based on a saddle-point formulation of the director vector sub-problem. It introduces a Lagrange multiplier that allows to enforce the sphere condition. In this setting, we can consider the limit problem (without penalty) and the penalized problem (using a Ginzburg-Landau penalty function) in a unified way. Further, the resulting schemes have a stable behavior with respect to the value of the penalty parameter, a key difference with respect to the existing schemes. Two different methods have been considered for the time integration. First, we have considered an implicit algorithm that is unconditionally stable and energy preserving. The linearization of the problem at every time step value can be performed using a quasi-Newton method that allows to decouple fluid velocity and director vector computations for every tangent problem. Then, we have designed a linear semi-implicit algorithm (i.e. it does not involve nonlinear iterations) and proved that it is unconditionally stable, verifying a discrete energy inequality. Finally, some numerical simulations are provided. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Variational multiscale methods lead to stable finite element approximations of the Navier-Stokes equations, dealing with both the indefinite nature of the system (pressure stability) and the velocity stability loss for high Reynolds numbers. These methods enrich the Galerkin formulation with a subgrid component that is modeled. In fact, the effect of the subgrid scale on the captured scales has been proved to dissipate the proper amount of energy needed to approximate the correct energy spectrum. Thus, they also act as effective large-eddy simulation turbulence models and allow one to compute flows without the need to capture all the scales in the system. In this article, we consider a dynamic subgrid model that enforces the subgrid component to be orthogonal to the finite element space in the L 2 sense. We analyze the long-term behavior of the algorithm, proving the existence of appropriate absorbing sets and a compact global attractor. The improvements with respect to a finite element Galerkin approximation are the long-term estimates for the subgrid component, which are translated to effective pressure and velocity stability. Thus, the stabilization introduced by the subgrid model into the finite element problem does not deteriorate for infinite time intervals of computation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract = {We design stabilized methods based on the variational multiscale decomposition of Darcy's problem. A model for the subscales is designed by using a heuristic Fourier analysis. This model involves a characteristic length scale, that can go from the element size to the diameter of the domain, leading to stabilized methods with different stability and convergence properties. These stabilized methods mimic different possible functional settings of the continuous problem. The optimal method depends on the velocity and pressure approximation order. They also involve a subgrid projector that can be either the identity (when applied to finite element residuals) or can have an image orthogonal to the finite element space. In particular, we have designed a new stabilized method that allows the use of piecewise constant pressures. We consider a general setting in which velocity and pressure can be approximated by either continuous or discontinuous approximations. All these methods have been analyzed, proving stability and convergence results. In some cases, duality arguments have been used to obtain error bounds in the L2-norm. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

We define an anisotropic time-space discretization as a family of time-space partitions that does not satisfy the condition h2≤ C $\delta$ t with C uniform with respect to h and $\delta$t. Standard residual-based stabilization techniques are motivated by a multiscale approach, approximating the effect of the subscales onto the large scales. One of the approximations is to consider the subscales quasi-static (neglecting their time derivative). It is well known that these techniques are unstable for anisotropic time-space discretizations. We show that the use of dynamic subscales (where the subscales time derivatives are not neglected) solves the problem, and prove optimal convergence and stability results that are valid for anisotropic time-space discretizations.

abstract = {In this article we address the numerical simulation of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems featuring large added-mass effect. We analyze different preconditioners for the coupled system matrix obtained after space-time discretization and linearization of the FSI problem. The classical Dirichlet-Neumann preconditioner has the advantage of "modularity" because it allows to reuse existing fluid and structure codes with minimum effort (simple interface communication). Unfortunately, its performance is very poor in case of large added-mass effects. Alternatively, we consider two non-modular approaches. The first one consists in preconditioning the coupled system with a suitable diagonal scaling combined with an ILUT preconditioner. The system is then solved by a Krylov method. The drawback of this procedure is that the combination of fluid and structure codes to solve the coupled system is not straightforward. The second non-modular approach we consider is a splitting technique based on an inexact block-LU factorization of the linear FSI system. The resulting algorithm computes the fluid velocity separately from the coupled pressure-structure system at each iteration, reducing the computational cost. Independently of the preconditioner, the efficiency of semi-implicit algorithms (i.e., those that treat geometric and fluid nonlinearities in an explicit way) is highlighted and their performance compared to the one of implicit algorithms. All the methods are tested on three-dimensional blood-vessel systems. The algorithm combining the non-modular ILUT preconditioner with Krylov methods proved to be the fastest. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The problem is formulated in terms of equilibrium equations with a blending between the continuum stress and the atomistic force in the interphase. Coupling between the continuum and the atomistics is established by imposing constraints between the continuum solution and the atomistic solution over the interphase sub-domain in a weak sense. Specifically, in the examples considered here, the atomistic domain is modeled by the aluminum embedded atom method (EAM) inter-atomic potential developed by Ercolessi and Adams [F. Ercolessi, J.B.

After that, the fully discrete method is considered. We obtain optimal error estimates in both space and time in a mesh dependent norm. The analysis reveals that the ALE approach introduces an upper bound for the time step size for the results to hold. The results obtained for the fully discretized second order scheme (in time) are associated to a weaker norm than the one used for the first order method. Nevertheless, optimal convergence results have been proved. For fixed domains, we recover stability and convergence results with the strong norm for the second order scheme, stressing the aspects that make the analysis of this method much more involved. {\textcopyright} 2006 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract = {In this paper we treat several aspects related to time integration methods for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations that allow to uncouple the calculation of the velocities and the pressure. The first family of schemes consists of classical fractional step methods, of which we discuss several possibilities for the pressure extrapolation and the time integration of first and second order. The second family consists of schemes based on an explicit treatment of the pressure in the momentum equation followed by a Poisson equation for the pressure. It turns out that this "staggered" treatment of the velocity and the pressure is stable. Finally, we present predictor-corrector methods based on the above schemes that aim to converge to the solution of the monolithic time integration method. Apart from presenting these schemes and check its numerical performance, we also present a complete set of stability results for the fractional step methods that are independent of the space stability of the velocity-pressure interpolation, that is, of the classical inf-sup condition. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.
