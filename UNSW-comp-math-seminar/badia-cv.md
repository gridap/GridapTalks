### Publications in major international peer-reviewed scientific journals {-}

Since 2006, I have (co-)authored 73 articles in scientific journals with JCR impact factor. More than 90\% of these publications are among the top-rated journals (first quartile) in computational engineering and scientific computing fields, which is a good measure of the quality of my research. I have also authored 4 book chapters, 1 book, 16 peer-reviewed proceedings,
and 4 articles under review. My research articles are about advanced finite element techniques and numerical analysis, large scale scientific computing, multiphysics and multiscale simulations, computational solid and fluid mechanics and electromagnetism. Based on Google Scholar, the impact measures of my research are: 3,055 citations (since 2006); h-index 30; i10-index 56. A selection of my publications, included the 10 best, can be found in the Sect. F22.

### Presentations in peer-reviewed, internationally established conferences {-}

I have presented my research at more than 90 international conferences (most of them by invitation, many keynote lectures). I have been selected as a semi-plenary lecturer (3 speakers in parallel) at the World Congress on Computational Mechanics (July 2014) with almost 4,000 attendees. I have been plenary lecturer at the HTS Modelling 2018, YIC 2017 and Coupled Problems’15 (both ECCOMAS conferences), HPCSE2015, and the Jacques-Louis Lions School 2012. I have been selected by the ERC to be scientific speaker (only 4 selected among all ERC grantees) at the Annual Meeting of New Champions 2015, organized by the World Economic Forum. I have given seminars at research institutions worldwide (ETH, Swansea University, Czech Academy of Sciences, Max Plank Institute, INRIA, Univ. Sevilla, Politecnico Milano, Sandia Labs, EPFL, FSU, etc.).

### Scientific leadership and research independence {-}

I have been the leader and founder of the Large Scale Scientific Computing Department at CIMNE, initially funded by the ERC Starting Grant COMFUS during the period 2011-15, but also from other European and national projects. I have attracted more than 3.5 million EUR in funding. I have been the the PI of 11 projects (6 European projects and 5 National projects), and task leader or collaborator in other 6 European projects. I commenced at Monash in June 2019, where I want to set up a world-leading team in computational science. For the moment, I have hired one PhD student (starting in February 2020), one Level B Research Fellow (A Martin, starting in January 2020), and I am in the process to hire one PhD student in the IITB-Monash Academy (together with A/Prof A Patra). I still supervise the research of some PhD and postdocs I have just left in Barcelona: postdocs F. Verdugo, D. Garcia, and M. Caicedo and PhD students J. Bonilla (defense in November 2019), E. Miranda (defense in April 2020), and J. Martorell (expected defense in 2021).

### Open source scientific software development {-}

I am the leading developer of `FEMPAR` (Finite Element Multiphysics PARallel code), an open source scientific code under GPU/GPL license. The `FEMPAR` project started in 2011 in the frame of my ERC Starting Grant COMFUS. `FEMPAR` is a parallel hybrid OpenMP/MPI object-oriented framework for the massively parallel finite element simulation of multiphysics problems governed by partial differential equations (solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, electromagnetism, thermal analysis). `FEMPAR` has been designed to tackle multiphysics, nonlinear, and multiscale problems. For such problems, it makes use of scalable implicit massively parallel solvers that are based on a novel implementation of Multilevel Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints (MLBDDC) preconditioning ideas, combined with fully-coupled block LU preconditioning. The code has been proven to have excellent weak scalability properties up to half million cores and two million MPI tasks on one of the largest supercomputers in Europe (JUQUEEN) and efficiently runs on supercomputers worldwide (CURIE; HERMIT; HPC-FF; MARENOSTRUM; MINOTAURO; HELIOS). `FEMPAR` can be considered one of the most scalable domain decomposition solver worldwide, and it has been included in the High-Q Club of the most scalable European codes (maintained by Jülich Supercomputing Center). The largest problem I have solved with `FEMPAR` involved about 60 billion unknowns on structured meshes and 10 billion unknowns on unstructured meshes.

In 2019 I initiated the `Gridap` project, which heavily relies on functional programming and multiple dispatching in Julia, a new programming language that originated at MIT in 2011, with the aim to create an easy-to-use but very efficient PDE solver. The main motivation of this project is to attain both the productivity of dynamically typed programming languages and the performance of statically typed ones through just-in-time compilation and automatic data type inference. It should drastically reduce the getting started time of new developers (PhD students and postdocs), and a reduced time dedicated to coding new algorithms.

### HPC resources {-}

I have access to some of the largest supercomputers worldwide through international and national calls, as well as via collaborations with supercomputing centers, due to the excellent parallel performance of the `FEMPAR` code. In particular, I have been the PI of the TIER-0 project EXCOMM — EXtreme scale domain decomposition solvers for COMputational Mechanics, with 10 million core hours on Fermi (Italy). I have had granted access to HLRN supercomputing center through the EU project NUMEXAS. I have also obtained about 18,000,000 core-h at JUQUEEN (Jülich, Germany) during the last three years, which allowed us to do the largest scale runs to prove the excellent scalability of `FEMPAR` at extreme scales. Other resources: >2,000,000 core-h at MN-3 (BSC, Spain); 300,000 core-h at HPC-FF (Jülich, Germany); 200,000 node-h at HELIOS (CSC, Japan); 400,000 core-h at CURIE (CEA, France); 100,000 core-h) at HERMIT (HLRS, Germany). I have uninterrupted granted access to Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) supercomputers since 2011.

### Technology transfer {-}

* Collaboration with *Amphos21* and *Institute of Earth Sciences Jaume Almera*  in the development of predictive tools for direct and inverse problems in subsurface modelling, including uncertainty and quantification, with applications in salt wedge modelling, nuclear repositories modelling, artificial recharge of aquifers, and induced sismicity.
* Collaboration with *CIEMAT* (National Fusion Lab) in the development of CAE tools (mainly in the frame of `FEMPAR`) for the design of novel breeding blanket designs for fusion reactors.
* Collaboration with the SME Oxolutia in order to customize `FEMPAR` to aid in the design process of superconductor wires. This collaboration has also been supported through the EU project FORTISSIMO.
* Collaboration with the engineering and manufacturing firm *STAM* (Italy), to provide scientific software to simulate and optimize AM processes for improving gearboxes production. This collaboration was supported through the EU project Cloudflow.

### Collaborations {-}

I have collaborated with researchers from all over the world, as one can see in my publication list (EPFL, Sandia, Politecnico di Milano, Brown, Imperial College, UCLA, UPC, Monash, Curtin, USevilla, Czech Academy of Science, KIT, IISC, Columbia, RPI, UFlorida, etc). During this proposa, I plan the following research visits funded by the in-kind travel contributions from Monash:

* __Dr John Shadid (Sandia National Labs, Albuquerque, USA):__ Dr Shadid and I have worked together in the design of monotonic finite element methods. One of my PhD students has been at Sandia National Labs during 6 months in 2019 and now has got a postdoc position that will start in 2021 to work further on this topic. I plan to visit Sandia during the project to advance in this research (Task 2.2 in D1).
* __Dr Chris Kees (US Army of Engineers, Vicksburg, USA):__ Dr Kees will visit Monash for one month in February 2020 to start a collaboration on unfitted space-time schemes. I also plan a visit in 2021 to his institution to keep the collaboration active (Task 2.1 in D1).
* __Dr Francesc Verdugo (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain):__ Dr Verdugo has worked with me on some of my last developments towards reliable embedded finite element methods. We have co-developed the Gridap Julia framework that will be used for all the developments within this framework. I plan a number of research stays in both directions to reinforce all this ongoing work (Tasks 1.1-1.4 in D1).
* __A/Prof Anirban Patra (IITB, Mumbai, India):__ A/Prof Patra is a material scientist with expertise in crystal plasticity and computational materials gained at Los Alamos National Labs and Georgia Tech. We have started a collaboration on advanced numerical methods for computational material modelling in additive manufacturing supported by the IITB-Monash Academy via PhD students (to be hired soon). I plan a number of research stays in both directions to reinforce our collaboration (Task 41-4.2 in D1).
* __Prof Victor Calo (Curtin University, Australia):__ Prof Calo is a world-leading highly-cited research in the field of isogeometric analysis. Prof Calo will visit Monash in February 2020 to foster collaborations. I am particularly interested in working with him on adaptive spline-based discretizations. I plan to do some research stays at Perth during the project (Task 2.2 in D1).
